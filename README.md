# PAR Database for Hate Speech Detection in Albanian YouTube Comments

## Introduction
This repository contains the PAR (Politics, Actuality, Reality) database, specifically designed for hate speech detection in Albanian YouTube comments. The database is associated with the paper titled "Fine-Tuning GPT-3.5 for Hate Speech Detection in Albanian YouTube Comments: Challenges and Analysis" by Hersi Kopani and Rovena Llapushi.

## Abstract
Hate speech is a prevalent issue on social media platforms, presenting a challenge for automated detection, especially in low-resource languages. The PAR database, derived from YouTube comments related to politics, actuality, and reality shows, addresses this challenge by providing labeled data for hate speech detection in Albanian content. This repository hosts the database used in the study comparing the performance of the GPT-3.5 model on detecting hate speech in these comments. The study evaluates the model's performance across different topics, analyzes the impact of translating comments from Albanian jargon to standard Albanian, and debates the necessity of large language models for hate speech detection tasks.

## Keywords
Hate speech, social media, low-resource language, fine-tuning LLMs.

## Usage
To utilize the PAR database for hate speech detection research or experimentation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NLP-HateSpeechAlb.git
